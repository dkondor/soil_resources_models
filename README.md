# soil_resources_models

Code and scripts for numerical solutions of the models in our paper:<br>
Kondor D, Turchin P (2022). Soil fertility depletion is not a credible mechanism for population boom/bust cycles in agricultural societies. https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rjns2/

This repository includes C++ code (using the [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) [ODE solvers](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/ode-initval.html)) to calculate numerical solutions of resource-consumer models.

It also includes shell script to calculate solutions with the parameters combinations used in our paper and R scripts that create example plots.
